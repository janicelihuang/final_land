<<6/1/2016>>
- changed check_sprite_bounds() function in level_main.cpp (incomplete)
- added generate_hit_box() function to utils.cpp
- added hit_box (vector of VertexArray) to Extended_Sprite class 
- added "direction" boolean variable to Extended_Sprite class
  + for flipping sprite left/right
- added for_debug() function to level_main.cpp
- cropped out transperent pixels in dark_adept.png

<<6/3/2016>>
- fixed x-axis check_sprite_bounds() function in level_main.cpp (incomplete, y-axis)
- working on twitchy movement of character sprite

<<6/6/2016>>
- set window boundaries for character sprite (still edge cases to fix)
- created [crude] player-tracking function in utils.cpp
    + returns vector of -1, 0, or 1 depending on where the player is in relation to mob
    + have not yet implemented second element of vector (first: x-pos, second: y-pos)
    + changed move_mobs() in level_main.cpp to implement this function (1% chance per cycle that mobs will move)

- created draw functions for each entity (player, mob, grid_lines, hit_boxes, etc)
- created map.cpp and tile.cpp, with a Map containing a vector of pointers to Tiles
- added new png, ground_tile.png
- FIXED: sprite collision with ground tiles, in check_sprite_bounds() in level_main.cpp

- NOTE: figure out how to slow down slime squishy
- NOTE: figure out proper scaling for ground_tile png
- NOTE: commented out draw_map() function (tentative tiling method)
- NOTE: speed of slimes may depend on machine clock speed...

<<6/7/2016>>
- changed chance of x-axis slime movement to 10%
- added prev_x and prev_y fields to Extended_Sprite class 
    + for sprite collisions: at intersection, revert to original position
- changed vertical movement to implement jumping, still buggy
- added gravity function that is falled each frame, ground detection needs fixing

- fixed jumping, but needs polishing
- NOTE: must clean up code

<<6/8/2016>>
- Added Debug Switch: (Num1) 
    + pressing Num1 will switch debug-mode on/off
- divided logic of move_slime() amongst slime objects (slime.cpp)

<<6/9/2016>>
- created stage.cpp 
    + moved initalize_grid_lines() and initialize_tiles() (originally initialize_map()) from level_main.cpp to stages.cpp
    + includes the following fields:
        + tiles: vector of vector of Tile pointers
        + block_hardness: vector of vector of bool  
        + x_lines_v, y_lines_v from level_main.h (for grid lines)
        + moved grid_counter from level_main.cpp
- added h file for Tile class 
- NOTE: hard_blocks and soft_blocks are still in level_main.cpp, need to be replaced by tiles in stages.cpp

<<6/10/16>>
- added hard_blocks and soft_blocks to stages.cpp
    + tiles used for collisions
    + hard/soft_block vectors used for draw_map()
- replaced 2d vector block_hardness in stage.cpp with boolean field in Tile class

<<6/11/16>>
- changed scale of sprites to (.25, .25)
